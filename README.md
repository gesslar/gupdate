# Public-Domain

This template repo contains

- `README.md` - this file
- `LICENSE.txt` - Public domain Unlicense
- `.github/dependabot.yml` - Nightly script to ensure you're using latest GitHub actions.

When using this template, you may also opt into bringing with it the `dev` branch. 🤷🏻‍♂️

Enjoy.
